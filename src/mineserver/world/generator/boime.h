/*This will be used to generate the custom boimes
I think it would be difficult to match them with
the notch client ones. Although i may try to do
this later.
The actual seed that the client gets should be 0.
I think this stops client boimes from being generated
although i am not 100% sure.
I will generate the custom boimes in a similar way
with temperature and rainfall but i will also add the
the higher you get the more the temperature will decrease
as well as having it somewhat 'random' from the actual
seed.*/
